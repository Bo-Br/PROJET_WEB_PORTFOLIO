# Begginer-Portfolio-Template-Website
This will be my playground for web developpement

---

Description:
Portfolio template website built using pure HTML, CSS and JavaScript without external libraries.

Features:
- Dark/Light mode using CSS variables and class toggling
- Responsive layout using Flexbox and media queries
- API data fetching using async/await
- Dynamic DOM rendering

Tech stack:
- HTML5
- CSS3 (Flexbox, Variables, Media Queries)
- JavaScript (Fetch API, async/await, DOM manipulation)

  ## HTML
  Well, here my HTML structure is pretty *simple*, and because of the fact that I was doing this project while learning **basic** html, css and javascript, I just made up the *whole structure* in the Html file, just threw all the div's in it, not using any kind of database. I will upgrade it in my **next** personal Web projects. 

  ## CSS 
  Well I don't think that I can say much about my **css** level here, it's also pretty *basic*, although I **really** like how I did the **Dark/light mode feature**, using css **variables**, and placing them into `:root`, changing it's class with **jvascript**. I also used the **media queries** feature of css to make the page a little bit **more responsive** that it already is with the **flex** module. I struggled a lot with the **navbar** objects, but css hopefully helped a lot placing objects with the **flex** module. I haven't used the css **grid** because **flex** is more instinctive for me *personally*.

  ## JAVASCRIPT
  For **javascript** I want to actually say that ***I liked it a lot***, at first glance when we were at school everybody just kept saying that **javascript** would be a **pain in the *head***, and it actually was, at start, but when I started understanding it... That feeling is just awesome. So for this project I needed using **javascript** for my dark mode feature and for **API** interaction. I really liked that part because I finally understood how to interact the DOM adding objects in it, while taking data from **API**'s with the `async/fetch/await` procedure. 

---
Actually, I want to talk a bit more about **API**'s. At first I was told that there was three methods :
  - the **XMLhttpRequest** method that was described as an *outdated* version
  - the **/.then** method that was described as a *normal* version
  - and the **async/await** method, that was described like a *new* version (kinda new - 2017)
    
So, I started using the .then version because I understood it very fast, and the **async** method was not really mentioned at first... So I used it in my work at school... 
Then I discovered the **async** version, and because of the fact that I was already used to **.then** I just ignored it. 
Then I discovered the fact that it's the most recent one and that I need to learn it. So I tried, and at first I hated it... I don't even know why now, but then I just compaired it with **.then** and was actually surprised how easy and more readable it was. Since then I am using it with great pleasure, and it also helps me understanding and practicing creating and using **javascript** functions, because it's a little bit different from **python**.

For DOM interaction at first I was creating objects and configuring them manually step-by-step, like this:

<img width="500" height="500" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c43257c5-176f-47ef-b681-8abc83c33eb5" />

But then I discovered the `innerHTML` possibility that was easier to read and understand:

<img width="500" height="500" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/abaae21f-5d88-4e5d-a7b2-75e37aa5613f" />

So now I'm sticking to the innerHTML version for now, even if the last one gave me understanding of the process.

If you need some more explanations I tried my best to write comments in the `css` and `js` files. 
Thanks for reading!
